# It is an old weather app i wrote it for my university project and for my python project.
## This project made with python, tkinter and request module 
<p> It helped me alot to be fluent in python.</p>
<p> It is exe file you can pull and use it or just change the codes</p>
<p> The UI and UX in this is not great and it is old so you can change it with tkinter</p>
